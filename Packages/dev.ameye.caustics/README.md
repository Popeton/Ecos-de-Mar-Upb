## Quick Start

After importing the asset into Unity, you can open the compatibility check window. Click on *Window > Caustics > Compatibility* and click on the *Check Compatibility* button. This will verify that everything is set up correctly in your project.

Caustics can be created by using a caustics volume. You have 3 options to do this.

- Click on GameObject > Effects > Caustics Volume to add a caustics volume
- Use the Caustics Volume prefab located under the Water Caustics for URP > Prefabs folder
- Add the caustics material to a cube mesh in your scene, this cube will now act as the caustics volume

The first option is the easiest one.

This asset comes with a nice and clean material editor to edit the properties of the caustics. This editor will simply show up in the material section in the inspector if you have the caustics volume selected. What each of these properties does, can be found in the documentation.

## Compatibility

Water Caustics for URP is compatible with **Unity 6**, **Unity 2022.3** and the **Universal Render Pipeline**. Other combinations are not supported.
